Configuring ``matplotlib`` to work with OSX

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For OSX Users: VTK is currrently very touchy with its Python library.
There are at least three possible ways to make it work:

#. Use system Python.
#. Use brew Python 3.5 and build vtk from source with Python3 using brew. This can be accomplished
   with::

       brew install vtk --with-python3 --without-python

#. Use Anaconda Python 2.7. Install ``vtk`` using the ``conda`` installer::

       conda install vtk

   If you have Anaconda Python 3.5 installed, this will throw an error and you
   will not be able to install it. You may create a conda virtual environment using
   Python 2.7 with the command::

       conda create -n ENVNAME python=2.7 anaconda

   and then activate it with ``source activate ENVNAME``. For more information
   about Anaconda Python, see `here <https://www.continuum.io>`__.

Furthermore, if you are not planning on using VTK, simply comment this line out in
``opacplot2.__init__.py``::

    from .opg_vtk       import *
