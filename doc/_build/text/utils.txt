"interp"
========


"interpDT()"
------------

Usage:

   interpDT(arr, dens, temps, d, t,
            bcdmin=BC_BOUND, bcdmax=BC_BOUND,
            bctmin=BC_BOUND, bctmax=BC_BOUND,
            log = False, lookup=INTERP_FUNC)

"interpDT()" takes a data array "arr" such as electron energy, a
density array "dens", a temperature array "temps", and a density point
"d" and temperature point "t". It also has options for the boundary
conditions on the densities and temperatures. It adjusts for
logarithmic values with the "log" flag. What "interpDT()" returns is
dependent upon the "lookup" argument.


Boundary Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"BC_BOUND" is the default setting. If "d" (or "t") is smaller than the
smallest value in the "dens" (or "temps") array, then "d" ("t") will
automatically be set to this smallest value.

"BC_EXTRAP_ZERO" will set "d" ("t") to zero if it is smaller than the
smallest value in the "dens" ("temps") array.


Lookup
~~~~~~

"INTERP_FUNC" will interpolate the two points around "d" and "t" to
return a value from "arr" for the desired point.

"INTERP_DFDD" will interpolate the two points around "d" and "t" to
calculate the first-order density derivative in "arr".

"INTERP_DFDT" will interpolate the two points around "d" and "t" to
calculate the first-order temperature derivative in "arr".
