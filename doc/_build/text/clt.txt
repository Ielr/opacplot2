Opacplot2 supports a number of Opacity/EoS table formats that are
listed in the Introduction.

It is possible to directly convert between two table formats with a
suitable Python script. A more systematic way consist in converting
the source file to the HDF5 format which is then converted to the
output format:

   input table -> HDF5 EoS/Opacity format  ->  output table

Convenience scripts exist to perform this function, installed as:
"opac_table2hdf" and "opac_hdf2table".

After installation of "opacplot2", these two scripts will be placed in
the system's path and can be called using "opac_table2hdf" and
similarly "opac_hdf2table".


"opac_table2hdf"
================

Located in "opacplot2.scripts.opac_table2hdf".

Usage:

   opac_table2hdf [-h] [-t {multi,ionmix,hdf5,propaceos}] [-o OUTNAME] [--Znum ZNUM] [--Xnum XNUM] input_file

This will take a file, "input_file" of the type specified by the "-t"
tag and convert it to an HDF5 file with a name specified by the "-o"
tag.

In general, one will have to specify the atomic numbers and material
fractions by using "--Znum" and "--Xnum", respectively. These are
comma separated lists.


"opac_hdf2table"
================

Located in "opacplot2.scripts.opac_hdf2table".

Usage:

   opac_hdf2table [-h] [-t {multi,ionmix,ascii}] [-o OUTFILE] input_file

This will take a file, "input_file" of HDF5 format and convert it to a
file of the type specified by "-t", with a name specified by "-o".


Other Tools
===========


"opacplot2"
-----------

**Has not been tested!**

Located in "opacplot2.scripts.main".

This script is used to automate EoS/opacity tables generation for
*FLASH* from the SESAME database.

Usage:

   opacplot2 [-h] [-d DBDIR] [-t DBTYPE] -n TABLENUM [-o OUT]

where:

   -d DBDIR, --dbdir DBDIR             Path to the database. Default: current directory.

   -t DBTYPE, --dbtype DBTYPE          Database type. Currently only supports SESAME (default).

   -n TABLENUM, --tablenum TABLENUM    Table ID.

   -o OUT, --out OUT                   Output Filename. Default: DBTYPE-eos-TABLENUM


"opacdump"
----------

Located in "opacplot2.scripts.main".

Currently not working, fails with "KeyError: 'rho'".


"opac_checkhdf"
---------------

Located in "opacplot2.scripts.main".

Currently not working, fails with "KeyError: 'dens'".


"opac_diff"
-----------

Located in "opacplot2.scripts.opac_diff".

Currently not working, fails with "KeyError: 'rho'".
